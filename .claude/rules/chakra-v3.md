# Chakra UI v3

This project migrated v2 → v3 in PR #19. The v2 APIs are gone; do not reintroduce them.

## API

- `createSystem(defaultConfig, config)` — never `extendTheme` / `extendBaseTheme`.
- `<ChakraProvider value={system}>` — `value=`, not `theme=`. Provider lives at
  `src/components/ui/provider.tsx` and is shared by `_app.tsx` and the Storybook preview.
- `gap`, never `spacing`, on Stack/VStack/HStack.
- Run `bun run theme` (`chakra typegen`) after editing `src/lib/theme.ts`.
- Keyframes are referenced by name via `animationName`; v3 dropped the `keyframes` export.

## `as={X}` → `asChild` + `<X>` as the singleton child

```tsx
// WRONG — typechecks clean, renders a <div>, silently destroys ul/li semantics
<VStack {...listStyleProps}>

// RIGHT
<VStack asChild><List.Root>…</List.Root></VStack>
```

Never flatten an `as={X}` into style props. It compiles, it looks right, and it throws
away the `ul` / `li` / `a` semantics the a11y tree depends on.

## Typecheck CANNOT catch a dead token

Every token-taking prop (`bg`, `color`, `maxW`, `gap`, …) also accepts an arbitrary
string. A dead token compiles clean, emits raw text as a CSS value, and the browser
**silently discards it**. In PR #19 all four gates were green while 16 real visual
regressions sat in the diff.

**Green CI is not evidence of visual correctness.** Chromatic is the only gate that sees
this class of failure.

Prove a token resolves before trusting it:

```ts
system.token("colors.x.y")   // → a real value, not undefined
system.css({ bg: "x.y" })    // → var(--chakra-*), NOT raw passthrough
```

**Three probe traps, each of which cost real time in PR2 (#22):**

1. **`system.token()` lies about semanticTokens.** It returns a literal for a plain token
   but a `var(--…)` **ref** for a semanticToken — there is no single flat value to return.
   Comparing both against a hex reports a **false FAIL on a correctly fixed token**. The
   trustworthy signal is the condition count:
   ```ts
   system.tokens.cssVarMap  // Map<condition, Map<cssVar, value>>
   // 1 condition = clean · >1 = a v3 default is contending
   ```
2. **`getTokenCss()` is not proof.** It is a config-time object. `conditions:{light:"&",
   dark:"&"}` looked correct there and was fatal in the browser. **Confirm computed styles
   on the real rendered widget** (Playwright is already a dep) before believing any fix.
3. **A transparent backdrop fakes a passing contrast ratio.** `rgba(0,0,0,0)` parses to
   black, which scores brilliantly against light text. Walk ancestors for the first opaque
   background — an idle tab's own `background-color` is transparent; its real backdrop is
   the list behind it.

## Colors: `tokens` vs `semanticTokens` — the rule INVERTS on collision

Both halves of this are load-bearing. Getting either wrong produces a dead token.

**Default: plain `tokens`.** In `semanticTokens`, `base` is the *default-condition* key,
so `primary: { base, dark }` registers `colors.primary` and **never** `primary.base` —
every `.base` call site then emits raw, invalid CSS. This app has no color mode, so
plain `tokens` is also the honest choice. Applies to project-owned names: `primary`,
`secondary`, `background`, `body`, `accent`, `warm`.

**Exception — names v3's `defaultConfig` already owns as semanticTokens MUST go in
`semanticTokens`.** These are `fg.*`, `bg.*`, `border.*` (v3 ships
`fg.muted`, `fg.subtle`, `border.subtle`, `bg.subtle`, `bg.muted`, `bg.panel`, …).

Verified empirically against `@chakra-ui/react@3.36.0` — a plain token loses on
**specificity**, not source order:

```
tokens.colors.fg.muted = "#a9bab9"  emits THREE declarations:
  &:where(html, .chakra-theme)   --chakra-colors-fg-muted: #a9bab9              ← ours, specificity 0
  :root &, .light &              --chakra-colors-fg-muted: var(--…-gray-600)    ← v3 default, WINS
  .dark &                        --chakra-colors-fg-muted: var(--…-gray-400)

semanticTokens.colors.fg.muted = "#a9bab9"  emits ONE:
  &:where(html, .chakra-theme)   --chakra-colors-fg-muted: #a9bab9              ← clean
```

`:where()` has **zero specificity**; `:root` is (0,1,0) and matches every document
unconditionally. So v3's light-mode gray wins **even though this app has no color mode
and never renders a `.light` class**. The design colour is dead and typechecks clean.

### The corollary: every v3 default renders its LIGHT branch on this dark site

The same `:root` mechanism has a second consequence, found in PR2 (#22). v3 ships **112**
default tokens with a `_light`/`_dark` pair (`bg.*`, `fg.*`, `border.*`, every
`<color>.solid/subtle/muted/…`, and the shadows). They emit as:

```
:root &, .light &     ← light values, specificity (0,1,0), :root matches ALWAYS
.dark &, …            ← dark values, same specificity, needs a .dark ancestor
```

This app has no color mode, so **nothing ever sets `.dark`** — the light branch wins every
time. **Every v3 widget we don't explicitly style is a LIGHT widget on a dark site.**

It first bit on the Projects tabs: v3's `enclosed` recipe put the tab list on `bg.muted`
(= `gray-100`), and once the redesign gave `fg.muted` its dark-canvas value the idle label
rendered at **1.84:1** — a WCAG failure that typechecked clean and that Chromatic could
only report as "1 visual change" behind a green check (`exitZeroOnChanges: true`).

**Fix pattern: pin the component to design tokens so it inherits no v3 surface.** Do not
reach for a color-mode switch:

- `class="dark"` on `<html>` **works** (measured 8.78:1) but declares a color mode this
  site does not have. **Rejected by Tyler:** with no dark mode, `.dark`/`.light` should not
  be targetable classes at all.
- `conditions: { light: "&", dark: "&" }` removes the classes but **kills all 112 tokens** —
  `&` alone does not match at the token root. Verified in a browser: `bg.muted` computes to
  empty. The `getTokenCss()` object dump looked correct; only computed styles caught it.

**The other 111 are still armed.** Any component leaning on a v3 default surface hits this
again.

Before adding any token group, check it against v3's defaults — assume collision, verify.
Only sub-keys that actually collide matter: `bg.canvas` / `bg.surface` / `bg.band` and
`fg.default` do **not** collide (v3 owns `bg.subtle`, `fg.DEFAULT`, etc.), so they are
fine as plain tokens.

### `DEFAULT` (uppercase) is the BARE-name key — `default` mints a dead sibling

v3's convention for "the value you get from the bare token name" is the uppercase key
**`DEFAULT`**. `#22` wrote it lowercase:

```ts
fg: { default: "…" }   // WRONG — mints colors.fg.default, referenced NOWHERE in src/
fg: { DEFAULT: "…" }   // RIGHT — registers the bare `colors.fg`
```

Lowercase `default` is treated as an ordinary sub-key: it creates a real-but-dead
`fg.default` token AND leaves the bare `fg` sitting on v3's default `_light` value — a
**black** `<html>` fg, masked on this site only by body's white. Same trap for `bg`.
Unlike `base` in semanticTokens (which *collapses* onto its parent), `DEFAULT` does not
collapse a lowercase sibling — the two coexist and the dead one typechecks clean. Fixed in
PR2: both `fg` and `bg` now resolve at **1 condition**.

### The "1 condition = clean" heuristic has a second exception: plain `radii` overrides

The condition-count probe (`>1 = a v3 default contends`) assumes the failure mode is a
specificity contest. It is not the only one. A plain-token override of `radii.l1/l2/l3`
reports **1 condition and is still dead** — the value never enters the registry at all, so
the emitted var stays `var(--chakra-radii-sm)`. Different failure class from the colors
case: nothing to out-specify, the token simply isn't registered. **Use `semanticTokens`
for radii overrides**, and confirm the computed `border-radius` on a real widget — 1
condition does not clear it here.

## v3 merges default recipes that v2 never had

v2's `extendBaseTheme` **emptied** `components`, so our recipes were the only component
styles. `createSystem(defaultConfig, …)` **merges Chakra's defaults**, which supply values
v2 never had — all invisible to the compiler. Seen in PR #19:

- outline Button inheriting `colorPalette.fg` (near-black on the dark surface)
- `size.lg`'s `textStyle:"md"` clobbering `fontSize`
- Heading `4xl`'s textStyle overriding `letterSpacing`
- Link's base `gap: 1.5`; a 1px transparent border on Button
- `borderRadius` `l2` (4px) vs v2's 6px

Neutralise with `textStyle: "none"` and explicit overrides. `sizes.container.*` was
re-added by hand — v3 dropped the scale, silently unbounding `maxW="container.*"`.

## Fonts must be declared at `:root`

Font families are CSS vars (`--font-tw`, `--font-mulish`, `--font-mono`) referenced from
`theme.tokens.fonts`, self-hosted via `@fontsource/*`. **Never** `next/font/google` — it
fetches at build time and intermittently ETIMEDOUTs on Vercel (fixed in #18).

Declare the vars at `:root` in **both** `src/pages/_app.tsx` and `.storybook/fonts.css`.
`--chakra-fonts-heading: var(--font-tw)` is substituted at computed-value time **on the
element where it is declared**, so a decorator-level wrapper cannot satisfy it: the token
computes to invalid, the empty value inherits down, and every font renders undefined —
typechecking clean the whole way. `.storybook/preview.tsx` must keep its `@fontsource`
and `./fonts.css` imports; drop them and Chromatic baselines the wrong typeface.
